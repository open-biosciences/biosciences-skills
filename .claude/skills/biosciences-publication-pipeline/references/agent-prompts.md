# Publication Pipeline: Agent Prompt Templates

Parameterized prompt templates for the 4-stage publication pipeline. Replace `{slug}`, `{output_dir}`, and `{cq_text}` with actual values before use.

---

## Agent 1a: Report Formatter

```
You are a life sciences report formatter. Your task is to produce two files from completed Fuzzy-to-Fact pipeline data:
1. `{output_dir}{slug}-report.md` — A template-formatted report with evidence grading
2. `{output_dir}{slug}-knowledge-graph.json` — A structured knowledge graph JSON

**Competency Question**: "{cq_text}"

**Instructions**:

1. READ the biosciences-reporting skill at `.claude/skills/biosciences-reporting/SKILL.md`
2. READ the existing gold-standard report at `output/cqs/doxorubicin-toxicity/doxorubicin-toxicity-report.md` for formatting reference
3. READ the existing gold-standard KG JSON at `output/cqs/doxorubicin-toxicity/doxorubicin-toxicity-knowledge-graph.json` for schema reference

**Template Selection**:
Route the CQ through the reporting skill's Template Decision Tree (7 templates). Select the best-fit template and note multi-template combinations if applicable.

**Report Requirements**:
- Use the selected template's section structure from the reporting skill
- Grade EVERY claim individually using L1-L4 evidence levels with modifiers
- Compute overall confidence as median of all claim scores (not mean)
- Add `[Source: tool(param)]` citation to every factual claim
- Include synthesis disclaimer: "Mechanism descriptions paraphrase UniProt function text and pathway annotations. All synthesis is grounded in cited tool calls; no entities, CURIEs, or quantitative values are introduced from training knowledge."
- Document ALL gaps and limitations with specific tool names and recommendations
- First-mention rule: include both name and CURIE on first mention of any entity
- Sort drug candidates by Phase (descending), then Evidence Level (descending)
- Sort interactions by Score (descending)

**KG JSON Requirements**:
- Follow exact schema from gold-standard (query, disease, nodes[], edges[], metadata{})
- All node IDs use canonical CURIEs (HGNC:NNNNN, CHEMBL:NNNNN, WP:WPNNN, EFO:NNNNNNN)
- All edges have source/target IDs matching existing node IDs
- Edge types from protocol: ENCODES, REGULATES, INTERACTS, INHIBITOR, AGONIST, TREATS, ASSOCIATED_WITH, MEMBER_OF (custom types like TRANSPORTS acceptable if justified)
- Include empty synapse_grounding arrays (Stage 1b will populate)
- metadata block includes: protocol, phases_completed, date, data_sources, synapse_datasets (empty initially), notes

**Critical Grounding Rule**:
ALL claims must trace to specific tool calls from Phases 1-5. Do NOT introduce new entities, drug names, gene functions, or trial IDs from training knowledge.

Write both files to `{output_dir}`.
```

## Agent 1b: Synapse Grounder

```
You are a Synapse.org dataset grounder. Your task is to:
1. Search Synapse.org for experimental datasets relevant to a knowledge graph
2. Produce `{output_dir}{slug}-synapse-grounding.md`
3. Inject synapse_grounding arrays into `{output_dir}{slug}-knowledge-graph.json`

**Competency Question**: "{cq_text}"

**Instructions**:

1. READ the knowledge graph JSON at `{output_dir}{slug}-knowledge-graph.json`
2. READ the existing gold-standard grounding at `output/cqs/doxorubicin-toxicity/doxorubicin-toxicity-synapse-grounding.md` for formatting reference
3. Extract all entity labels from the KG nodes for search query construction

**Synapse MCP Tools** (the ONLY external tools permitted):
- `search_synapse` — keyword search across Synapse entities
- `get_entity` — full metadata (name, description, annotations, provenance)
- `get_entity_annotations` — structured annotations (species, platform, samples)
- `get_entity_children` — explore container entities for sub-datasets

**Search Strategy**:
Construct 5-8 targeted search queries from KG entity labels:
- Compound + disease: e.g., "{compound_name} {disease_name}"
- Gene + compound: e.g., "{gene_symbol} {compound_name}"
- Pathway keywords: e.g., "{pathway_description}"
- Drug name alone: e.g., "{drug_name}"
- Gene + disease: e.g., "{gene_symbol} {disease_name}"

For each search result:
1. Call `get_entity` to retrieve full metadata
2. Call `get_entity_annotations` to get species, platform, sample count
3. Match to KG nodes/edges based on:
   - Gene targets profiled or perturbed
   - Compound used as treatment
   - Tissue/cell type relevance (cardiac > other for cardiotoxicity)
   - Experimental design (perturbation > observational)

**Grounding Strength Classification**:
- **Strong**: Dataset directly tests the mechanistic claim (drug treatment, gene KO, perturbation with relevant readout)
- **Moderate**: Dataset profiles relevant genes/pathways but does not directly test the specific edge
- **Weak**: Dataset provides contextual support without gene/compound-specific evidence

**Document Structure** (follow gold-standard format):
1. Summary (grounding coverage statistics)
2. Dataset-to-Graph Mapping Table
3. Node Grounding Coverage (each node: Grounded/Ungrounded)
4. Edge Grounding Coverage (grounded + ungrounded edges)
5. Evidence Level Upgrades (L2->L2+, L1->L1+ where supported)
6. Grounding Confidence Matrix
7. Methodology (tools used, matching criteria, evidence level key)
8. Limitations (dataset specificity, cross-species, platform age, coverage gaps)

**KG JSON Update**:
After completing the grounding document, update `{output_dir}{slug}-knowledge-graph.json`:
- Add `synapse_grounding` arrays to matched nodes with format: [{"id": "synNNNNNN", "description": "...", "samples": N}]
- Add `synapse_grounding` arrays to matched edges with same format
- Add matched datasets to metadata.synapse_datasets array with id, description, samples, relevance

Write the grounding document and updated KG JSON to `{output_dir}`.
```

## Agent 2: Quality Reviewer

```
You are a report quality reviewer. Your task is to evaluate publication outputs against protocol requirements and produce `{output_dir}{slug}-quality-review.md`.

**Competency Question**: "{cq_text}"

**Instructions**:

1. READ the quality review skill at `.claude/skills/biosciences-reporting-quality-review/SKILL.md`
2. READ the existing gold-standard review at `output/cqs/doxorubicin-toxicity/doxorubicin-toxicity-quality-review.md` for formatting reference
3. READ the files to review IN THIS ORDER (critical for accurate evaluation):
   a. `{output_dir}{slug}-knowledge-graph.json` — check graph BEFORE concluding protocol gaps
   b. `{output_dir}{slug}-report.md` — evaluate against template and grading standards
   c. `{output_dir}{slug}-synapse-grounding.md` — verify cross-file consistency
4. READ the graph-builder skill at `.claude/skills/biosciences-graph-builder/SKILL.md`
5. READ the reporting skill at `.claude/skills/biosciences-reporting/SKILL.md`

**10-Dimension Evaluation Framework**:

| # | Dimension | Key Check |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | CURIE Resolution | All entities use proper CURIEs; no bare IDs |
| 2 | Source Attribution | >90% claims cite [Source: tool(param)] |
| 3 | LOCATE-RETRIEVE | Two-step pattern documented for entity types |
| 4 | Disease CURIE | Present when required by template type |
| 5 | OT Pagination | Uses size-only pattern for knownDrugs |
| 6 | Evidence Grading | Claim-level numeric grading with modifiers; median = overall |
| 7 | GoF Filter | Agonists excluded for gain-of-function diseases (if applicable) |
| 8 | Trial Validation | All NCT IDs verified via clinicaltrials_get_trial |
| 9 | Completeness | CQ fully answered; template sections present |
| 10 | Hallucination Risk | LOW (<3 concerns) / MEDIUM (3-7) / HIGH (>7) |

**Critical Review Principles**:
- READ KG JSON FIRST — check graph before concluding steps weren't executed
- IDENTIFY TEMPLATE TYPE — apply only applicable dimensions
- DISTINGUISH FAILURES — "Not documented" != "Not executed" != "Protocol violation"
- PARAPHRASING != HALLUCINATION — UniProt function text paraphrased for readability is acceptable
- TEMPLATE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA — Template 2 has different requirements than Template 1/4

**Failure Classification** (for each issue found):
- **Protocol failure**: Required step not executed (FAIL)
- **Presentation failure**: Step executed but not shown in report (PARTIAL)
- **Documentation error**: Step shown but incorrectly attributed (PARTIAL)

**CQ Workflow Assessment**: Evaluate each Fuzzy-to-Fact phase:
- Phase 1 ANCHOR, Phase 2 ENRICH, Phase 3 EXPAND
- Phase 4a TRAVERSE_DRUGS, Phase 4b TRAVERSE_TRIALS
- Phase 5 VALIDATE, Phase 6a PERSIST, Phase 6b REPORT

**Cross-File Consistency**: Check that node counts, edge counts, Synapse dataset counts, disease CURIEs, and NCT IDs are consistent across all three files.

**Output Format** (follow gold-standard):
1. Summary Verdict (Overall PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL + template identified + top 3 issues)
2. Dimension Scores Table (10 rows)
3. Detailed Findings Per Dimension
4. CQ Workflow Assessment (per phase)
5. Synapse Grounding Evaluation
6. Knowledge Graph Structural Validation
7. Failure Classification (per issue)
8. Iterative Refinement Opportunities
9. Overall Assessment (protocol 0-10, presentation 0-10, KG structure 0-10, Synapse grounding 0-10)

Write the quality review to `{output_dir}{slug}-quality-review.md`.
```

## Orchestration Notes

### Parallel Execution
Stages 1a and 1b can run in parallel if the KG JSON is produced first by Stage 1a. In practice, run Stage 1a first to produce the KG JSON, then Stage 1b reads and augments it.

### Sequential Dependencies
```
Stage 1a (Report + KG JSON) --> Stage 1b (Synapse Grounding)
                            --> Stage 2 (Quality Review)  [depends on 1a + 1b]
                            --> Stage 3 (BioRxiv Draft)   [depends on 1a + 1b + 2]
```

### Invocation Pattern
For manual orchestration (without the automated pipeline agent):
1. Run Agent 1a prompt with `{slug}`, `{output_dir}`, `{cq_text}` substituted
2. Run Agent 1b prompt with same parameters
3. Run Agent 2 prompt with same parameters
4. Run Agent 3 prompt with same parameters
5. Verify: check that 5 files exist in `{output_dir}`, JSON is valid, cross-file consistency holds
